# PID Controlled Peltier Cooler

## Overview
This is a project I worked on at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The intent was to create a cost effective
temperature controller based on the PID library for Arduino.

## Prerequisites
The current setup is:
- Arduino Mega 2526
- TMP 102 temperature sensor
- Sparkfun Mosfet Power Control Kit.
- CPU cooler.
- Two power supplies, one for the fan, and another for the Mosfet.

You must have the latest version of Arduino installed. Processing is optional, to output serial data.

## Operating
- Set Power supply for fan to 12v, .5A
- Set Power supply for Mosfet to 8V, 2.5A (Depending on operation, this may change -- trace width on the pcb only supports
< 3A)
- Make sure pin 4 (PWM) is applied to gate of Mosfet.
