 Peltier ran at 3.6A @ 11.0V = 39.6W!
 
 The thermo-electric cooler (or Peltier) works well well with a computer power supply for power, a computer 
 CPU heat sink for cooling and a N-Channel MOSFET to control the power. The Peltier is going to use a ton 
 of juice. In this case, I  measured 3.6 amps at 11 volts! I had to attach the hot side of the Peltier 
 to a large computer CPU heat sink but it worked so well that the cold side was so cold I could not keep 
 my finger on the device.
 
 Because I was so scared of pumping 40 watts into a device, I used this program to slowly ramp
 up the power flowing through the MOSFET. Press 'a' to increase power, 'z' to step down.
